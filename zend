But command
# aptitude purge '~nzend.* '
didn't finish correctly as there were problems with packages 
jobqueue-zend-server 
and 
help-zend-server

And now the command

sudo aptitude -f install
-------------------------------------------------\
o uninstall Zend Server (leaving the configuration files in place) run:
 # aptitude remove '~izend'
To delete Zend Server from the system with no traces left run:
# aptitude purge '~nzend'
